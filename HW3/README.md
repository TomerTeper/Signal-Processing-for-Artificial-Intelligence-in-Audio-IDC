# Homework 3: Genre Classification with CNN-RNN

## Overview
This assignment explores the use of a **hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model for the task of **music genre classification**. The goal is to understand how combining CNNs and RNNs can be effective in extracting spatial and temporal features from audio signals represented as spectrograms.

The notebook provides partial code and instructions, guiding students through the process of model specification, training, and evaluation.

## Key Topics Covered
- Music genre classification  
- CNN for spatial feature extraction  
- RNN for sequential pattern modeling  
- Deep learning model construction in TensorFlow/Keras  
- Evaluation and visualization of model performance  

## Structure
The notebook is structured into the following sections:
1. **Introduction and Setup**: Loading libraries and defining constants.  
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Preparing audio spectrograms for input.  
3. **Model Architecture**: Designing the parallel CNN-RNN model.  
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model and analyzing performance.  
5. **Visualization**: Interpreting model predictions and metrics.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow (>=2.x)
